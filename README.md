# property-data
This is a simple demo of a Spring Boot app which allows the user to upload a csv file which lists property data and display it in a table. The user is then able to determine the following:

Average price for a user-specified postcode outward.
The price difference between two user-specified property types.
The highest cost properties by pre-defined percentage values (the results will be highlighted within the table).
